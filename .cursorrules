# ========================
# ALWAYS follow the guidelines in ARCHITECTURE.md when generating new code.
# ARCHITECTURE.md contains detailed rules for:
# - Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
# - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

GENERAL CODING RULES
========================

This project follows strict, explicit, and readable Python coding standards.

General:
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Write code that is easy to read, review, and refactor.
- Avoid hidden or implicit behavior.
- avoid magic string or numbers, use enum, constants or strong typed hint like Class.__name__ to replace magic string or numbers
- Max line length: 120 characters (configured in pyproject.toml for black and isort)

Typing:
- All variables, parameters, and return values MUST have explicit type hints.
- Class attributes MUST be type-annotated.
- Avoid using Any unless absolutely necessary and explicitly justified.
- Prefer concrete types over generic ones.

Naming:
- Class names MUST be PascalCase.
- Function and variable names MUST be snake_case.
- Constants MUST be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- File names MUST be snake_case.
